# 🧠 Student Mental Health Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

The Student Mental Health Detection System is a machine learning–based project designed to analyze student data and predict potential mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The system aims to support early detection and awareness, helping institutions and individuals take timely preventive measures.

This project is especially suitable for:

* Academic mini / major projects
* Machine learning beginners
* Mental health awareness applications

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze student-related data (academic, lifestyle, social factors)
* Identify patterns linked to mental health conditions
* Predict mental health risk using machine learning models
* Provide insights that can help in early intervention

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 Data preprocessing and visualization
* 🧠 Machine learning–based prediction
* 📈 Mental health classification (e.g., Normal, Stressed, Depressed)
* 📝 User-friendly input system
* 💾 Dataset-driven analysis
* 📉 Model performance evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook / Flask (optional)

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Load the student mental health dataset
2. Preprocess data (cleaning, encoding, normalization)
3. Train machine learning models
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
5. Predict mental health status based on new inputs

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset may include:

* Age, gender
* Academic workload
* Sleep duration
* Social interaction level and lifestyle
* Stress indicators
* Self-reported mental health responses

(Dataset can be collected via surveys or public sources)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

* Accuracy score
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion matrix
* Cross-validation results

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

* A student enters personal and academic details
* The system analyzes the input
* ML model predicts mental health risk level
* Result helps in awareness and early support

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Deep learning models for improved accuracy
* Real-time web application dashboard
* Mobile app integration
* Personalized mental health recommendations
* Counselor / admin dashboard

 machine learning to promote mental health awareness among students.
